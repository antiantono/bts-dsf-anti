0,My Favorite White Wine : This a fantastic white wine for any occasion!,
1,"Yum!! : Tart, not sweet...very refreshing and delicious!",
2,A New Favorite! : I was given this wine so it was a delightful surprise to find that it has a flavorful and delicious taste! A new favorite!!!!,
3,"Bold, Flavorful, Aromatic, Delicious : This is a phenomenal wine and my new favorite red.",
4,"Yum! Plus, Environmentally Friendly! : 4 750ml bottles for the price of two With way less packaging YES PLEASE! I was nervous it was too good to be true and I wouldn't like the wine but it's fantastic! I have to go a bit out of my way to get it (I live near a state line and it isn't sold in my state due to liquor laws) but it's worth it.",
5,Great Taste : I LOVE Becks NA. It tastes just like a regular ale. It smells like one too. It tastes great. It's the only NA that I drink. My friends love it too. It has a great head when you pour.,
6,Simply Wonderful : This wine has a wonderful but strong aroma its a bit bitter has a bite to it but still goodit was worth it in the end,
7,"A Sweet Red. : I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a 'sweet red'. Instead it get's poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Target's shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less.",
9,"Charles & Charles Red Blend : This is a very smooth red with Aromas of cocoa, coffee, tobacco sweet black cherry. Bold but soft. I highly recommend this one.",
10,"This Wine Made My Party! : Based on positive reviews, I served all of the Fancy Pants varieties at a recent party. My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads. Served well chilled, our Sauvignon Blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics.",
11,Nice Sparkling Wine Compared To Champagne : Nice fruity and sweet taking sparkling wine. Goes great in mimosa. You have to try it to see how you will like it. Even the guys would enjoy this at your wedding!,
12,Great Nh Beer! : A rich amber Ale with a subtle but noticeable hop character. Great beer to pair with food!,
13,"Dry-Hopped Ipa! : This light bodied IPA is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright HP aroma, balanced by a refreshing and crisp Ale. Great for a cookout out day at the beach, love it!",
14,"Dry-hopped Ipa! : This light bodied IPA is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright HP aroma, balanced by a refreshing and crisp Ale. Great for a cookout out day at the beach, love it!",
15,Lovely! Try It! : Great for a perfect summer day or a get together with the girls.,
16,Fizzy Pinot Grigio? : I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle or if it was intentionally made effervescent. I don't want bubbles when I drink Pinot Grigio. Goes well with mozzarella string cheese and Cinemasins.,
17,"Obsessed : Obsessed with this new drink----However, it has been sold out at every Target I have been to lately :(",
18,"Great Wine : This is an excellent red wine, not to dry and not real sweet. More of a red blend. Great go with anything anytime. In the right price point as other known brands on the market.",
19,Excellent Cab......!!!!!!! : One of the best Cabernets I had in quite sometime......!!!!!!,
20,"Highly Recommended : This is a great buy for the price. Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didn't want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.",
21,Michelob Ultra Light Cider : Gluten free plus lower on calories plus very refreshing!,
22,Please Don't Discontinue This Flavor Combination! : Best of the bunch of all of The wine Cube sku's. Target Wine Buyer: please bring back!,
23,"Wine Is Good - The Cube Is Not : I like the wine and I like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time. But when they re-sized the box a few months ago, it made it impossible to open and setup properly. While I applaud Target for reducing the packaging, this just isn't working.",
24,"Could Not Believe The Taste : I have tried my share of Moscato D' Astis before, this has to be the smoothest that I have ever tried. Not too sweet or too fizzy but perfect. I got it for the pretty bottle but was very surprised about the taste. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",
25,"My New Fave! : Highly, highly recommend!! It's sweet but not syrupy- just right! And I love that it's bubbly, I don't have to mix my wine with seltzer anymore!",
28,"Who Can Say No To Awesome $5 Wine : This wine is amazing! I'm an avid wine drinker (mom life) and I'll continue to buy this for sure. For 5 it's a steal! Keep this around please, it's just another reason to love target!",
29,Good Wine For Beginners... : Love it that it's not too dry or overly sweet. Also has a good balance of alcohol.,
30,Fantastic Wine : This wine was sooooo good. I usually don't like Cabernet but this special fermented wine is very tasty. It did not stay around too long.LOL.,
31,The Cube Riesling : Some of the best boxed wine I have ever tasted. Great taste and great value.,
32,Perfect For Summer : Love this Moscato and will be purchasing more on my next Target run. Let it chill in the fridge and enjoy on a hot summer day.,
33,We Loved It! : Had my sissies (sistafriends) over for dinner/planning meeting....and they're still talking about the loving fellowship and the great wine! I hope the store has more than 1 bottle left on its shelves!!!,
34,Yum! : Great fruity dry rose!,
35,"An Outstanding Table Wine : Is this the greatest wine in the world, of course not. It is an eminently drinkable wine,as a matter of fact it is my preferred, and go to, table wine. Wine is a personal thing but for me it is my 1 pick in the under 10 category. It is well balanced, subtle, and very easy to sip. Dry without being overpowering. It is not a big bad Cabernet but it is not that in a good way. Goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise. I always have a bottle on my shelf.",
36,"New Go To White : Delicious white wine! Light, crisp, not too sweet. Almost too good.",
37,No No No No No.... No : Just bad wine. The worst I have ever had. Try Bota Box Sarah is you are looking for a decent boxed wine.,
38,"Love This Love Noir : I am no wine expert by any means, but I love a good red for dinner or a cold night. This is the ticket. Rich, dark, fruity! Just lovely. The hubby liked it too!",
39,Best Wine I Ever Tasted : Best wine I ever tasted,
40,"Excellent Chardonnay : not fruity, very satisfying. my go to chardonnay! excellent product - would expect to pay 10 / bottle for this quality",
41,"Vintner's Red Boxed Wine : Picked some up on a trip to the beach as they are portable non breakable and priced right! I didn't know what to expect, honestly, my expectations were not too high, being boxed wine and all. I was pleasantly surprised! It is very drinkable delicious! When I got home I returned to Target to get the large wine cube box for at home enjoyment!",
42,"Great Sauvignon Blanc Even Compared To Medium-Priced Bottles : By far the best boxed wine I've found, and comparable to medium-priced bottled sauvignon blancs. A great buy.",
43,"Great Sauvignon Blanc Even Compared To Medium-priced Bottles : By far the best boxed wine I've found, and comparable to medium-priced bottled sauvignon blancs. A great buy.",
45,"Great Wine For The Price. : I didnt find this to be sweet at all, but everyones taste differs. I usually dont like sweet wines so I gravitate towards Chardonnay and some Sauvignon Blancs and I felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated. For the price, this is definitely a keeper.",
46,Love It! : My boyfriend brought this home on a whim. We were delighted at how tasty it was. Lasted us a couple weeks - even better!,
47,Delicious! : I love Disaronno. It has a smooth texture and the flavor is lightly sweet. It's decadent on the rocks or with a little cream.,
48,Great For The Price : I'm surprised how good this is for the price! Tastes more like Sauvignon blanc to me...,
50,"Pretty Good For Wine In A Box! : For as much as we drink white wine, I needed to find a budget bottle. We'd been doing 6-7 dollar bottles, but this beats that. And it's pretty good! You won't impress anyone with this, but for a Monday-Thursday, home and on a budget drinking, this is good.",
51,"This Wine Made My Party! : I served this and all the different varieties at a party. My guests and I loved them all. Since I am not a wine expert, I will simply give you some of the notes on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...a robust and rich palate with ripe berries, red fruit, and toasty oak flavors. Cherries and vanilla spice on the mouth lead to a long, lingering finish.",
52,"Tried The Past Type & It's My Favorite So This Should Be Great! : I tried Beringer, who makes this, Pink Moscato, had no trouble opening it up with a Corkscrew, one which I just bought from Target in-store, really like its sweet, fruity flavor pink looking wine. I plan to stock up for the Holidays.",
53,"A Scrumptious Red! : If you like a fruit forward blend of reds with a very smooth finish and jammy taste, you will love this! I think my 9 year search for my favorite red wine has ended!",
54,"Refreshing Rose! : This is a dry Rose, not sweet at all which is perfect for summer!",
55,"Favorite Rosé : A wonderful dry wine, and the taste is just divine!",
56,"Favorite Ros�� : A wonderful dry wine, and the taste is just divine!",
57,Now That's Cider : Been looking for Strongbow in the US for years,
58,"Refreshing : Refreshing, nice grapefruit flavor. Not for people that dislike seltzer water. It's good out of the can or poured over ice.",

62,"Deliciously Tangy : This Cayman Jack margarita is really good. I found it in a Southern California Target, but I can't find it in Northern California stores. :(",
63,"Decent Beer For A Good Price : I expected this beer to be on the bitter side the first time I tried it, but I still enjoyed its smooth taste. I'd definitely buy it if I get a chance.",
64,"Looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on ... : Looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on it so I ordered this puppy to put it to the test. definitely a switcher and fairly quiet. Well regulated Just like all of RM Italy products, great quality.",
65,"Luv This Wine : I love sparkling wine, but I find that most brands are sweet. I'm aging and no longer want the sweet stufd. This is medium body wine with strong bubbles (I love bubbles ) . The alcohol content offers a nice buzz fairly quickly. So ecstatic I found this brand and Target carries it.",

84,Best bourbon on earth. : I keep Jim Beam on hand every day of the week.,False
85,"A Bourbon Legend : I typically have this neat or with an ice cube. Its light amber appearance, sweet, woody, mossy nose, and its mild moss, white oak, mellow wintergreen mint, and dried, faintly-candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin-point distilling execution. Jim Beam Original has a gradual finish, with a ghost of chocolate powder, during the fade out. Highly recommended. RJT",False

106,"Solid tequila : My buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game. Frankly when it comes to tequila, I usually brace myself for a rough shot.

110,"""the Best Jerry, The Best"" : Pinnacle has been making our Martini's in my family for many years. My late father discovered it years ago when someone said it's on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter, but at a very reasonable price. Try it, bet you'll love it too. Al",

134,"Bitter Acrid Terrible Tea : Tastes absolutley nothing like Chinese restaurant tea... not even similar. It's absolutley horrible, bitter and acrid. With shipping I paid 50 cents per bag... what an amazing rip off. You can go to a local Oriental store and get this kind of stuff for 2 cents per bag... and it would probably taste better.",
135,Very good tea..... : I don't know why some people wrote bad reviews about this tea. It is just like the tea I've grown up with that I had in Chinese Restaurants. The only complaint I have is that I found the same tea while visiting an Asian store out of town and it was only 2.00 per box while this one was more than double plus a 2.99 shipping fee. I knocked the rating down one star because of the outrageous price this seller charges.,
136,"Loving It : Had a cup of this tea and it was like reliving the past. Always drank this blend at a small Chinese Resturant in Queens, NY. After my first sip I felt like I was back thier enjoying a big pot of tea. Smooth and Relaxing, great blend and will be ordering more soon.",
137,"Great tea!! : Yes! this IS just like the Chinese restaurant tea. I used to receive a tea bag or two from my favorite Chinese take out, but nobody does that anymore. I'd save my teabag for the next day to drink with the leftovers, to enhance the leftovers. Now, I can enjoy this tea anytime. This is a refreshing tea that does not make one feel as if we should be adding milk and/or eating some cookies or cakes with it. This tea can stand alone and refresh the inner soul. I drink it with just a pinch of sugar.",
138,"Fantastic Tea : I gave this to my husband for christmas and he loves it. Says it smells good, it has a nice flavor and a smooth texture, just like the tea you are served in Chinese Restaurants :)",
139,"Tasty blend of green, jasmine and oolong tea. Hard to find in stores where I live. : I really like this tea and have bought it many times. The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesn't contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people don't like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones don't even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions. (My store had carried it but stopped apparently due to this regional issue -- no longer available in our part of PA.) It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it! Thanks for carrying it, Amazon and friends!",
140,"ILOVETHISTEA : Really, that's all I have to say. I have ordered this tea several times. Tastes EXACTLY like the Chinese tea that you can find in any major Chinese restaurant.",
141,"Good taste, but is it real Ginseng : I really like the taste of the tea, especially cold. It's a green tea mixed with Ginseng, and they've added licorice root to perhaps sweeten the tea. I don't even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, I'm guessing it's a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, it's very tasty this way! You don't have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round.",
142,"Good taste And Good tea : I like all ingredients in this tea: Green tea, Licorice root and Ginseng. Specially Licorice root can relieve a spasmodic cough and test like Mint",
143,Good stuff : We like this brand especially when we make stir fry. Can't find it in the grocery stores any longer and was happy I could find it on line.,
144,"Great Taste And Great Value! : This is my favorite Riesling. When I spotted it on sale for 9.99 a bottle I was delighted. I usually pay around 12.99 at other locations. Buying two bottles saved me six dollars, Thanks Target.",
145,"Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat : Refreshing taste of beer especially for summer, citrus combined w/ blueberry.",
146,"Right On Target, Great After A Busy Day : Right on Target - Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale has outstanding character, warm, subtle hints of fruit and a strong but not overly bitter hop aftertaste. It is excellent after a hard day's work to kick back and relax. Target recently began carrying beer and I could not be more enthused! ...",

On a stressful day, I'll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor.

If you guys could fix that then it would be twice more amazing,
234,Great Product : I went to my local store to purchase another apple flavored product but saw this decided to purchase Jim Beam Apple instead. I'm glad that I did.

288,"Delicious! : This candy is amazing! I'm a BIG tea fan. Iced, hot, green, black, whatever kinda tea it is, i like it. The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday. Overall, some of the greatest hard candy i've ever tried, and by far, the best tea candy.",
289,"Delicious : This is a great candy, rich flavor, and everyone who tried it, loved it, I will be ordering this fine candy again.",
290,"Great way to try all three flavors... : This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Bali's Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real! Before doing that, I will buy a case of 12 packs from a vendor offering free shipping.",
291,"It's okay : Nothing to get up about and I thought it was expensive. I took them to work for everyone, there still there! lol",
292,It is tasty. : This is tasty. I liked it. The only drawback is that the individual wrappers are not sealed well so once the main package is opened many of them will get sticky in a month or two. Nor much of a problem really.,
293,LATTE TEA CANDY : Had already tried liked the Citrus Green Tea Candy. Thought I'd give this flavor a go - but muchly prefer the Citrus.,
294,Not a great flavor : Im a huge fan of BB's coffee candies and I adore green tea and matcha so I thought I would love these. They have a really odd taste after about 1 min in your mouth. I couldnt finish even one sadly and I was really looking forward to these.,
295,"Unusual but good! : Tried the Green Tea Latte while in Aruba and loved them! Tried the three pack and I'm hooked. I love the citrus best, but all are different and great throat lozenges (I hate menthol lozenges).",
296,Pretty Bottles : The bottles are very pretty we haven't opened them yet. They look just like the picture pink with the emoji on them. Delivery was on time.,
297,"Fantastic!!! : I have tried the Margarita mix and the Bloody Mary mix. The Margarita mix is fantastic, especially if you add a little lime juice. The Bloody Mary mix is also very good but I like the Zing Zang Bloody Mary a little better and I think it is worth the few extra carbs. I plan to try the rest of the Scales Mixes and have already restocked the Margarita mix.",
298,"Tasty mix ! : I love this margarita mix! It has a great taste, and in my opinion it does not taste like fake sugar at all. My husband however was not a fan - he found it much too tart. I think it's definitely worth a try!",
299,"Delicious! : I loved everything about this stuff. Now, I'm a local Charlestonian and can get this in my grocery store. But, if you are looking for a good healthy alternative to a Margarita, GO FOR IT! Their company website also offers this mix at a lower price. ENJOY!",
300,"GREAT PRODUCT- TERRIBLE PRICE! : 3 stars only because this really tasty No Calorie margarita mix cast me 17 FOR ONE BOTTLE!I'm a margarita fan and also trying to lose some weight. There aren't many really good lime mixers out there in the Low to NO Calorie category, so when I discovered SCALES on the shelf while visiting in Scottsdale AZ (for a reasonable 6.99 bottle), I was delighted to discover how tangy limey good it tastes- just right for excellent margaritas, but cutting about 100-150 calories out of your cocktail!I was dismayed when I returned home (though not exactly surprised) to find that Scales was not available in Washington state. So when I looked for it on Amazon and saw its other flavors offered on prime for 7.99 and the Margarita was offered at 17, I thought this must be for two or three bottles. When only one showed up... well, what the hell.Still a great mixer, but why can't we get it for a reasonable price!!",
301,"0 Carb, 0 Sugar, 0 Satisfaction : To me this tastes like a Crystal Light lemonade or lemon-lime mix. For the price and the many highly positive reviews, I had really expected something much tastier. I added the juice of two limes but still didn't care for the flavor compared to regular (not sugar-free) but less expensive margarita mixes I've tried. My spouse threw out his drink after one taste. We threw away the bottle so as not to waste any more tequila with this mix.",
302,Great taste... but pricey online... : For zero carbs/sugar this stuff is great. However the price online here is double that of my local grocery store. Unless I am missing something from the description that this is a multipack.If you are wanting a tasty zero carb drink this will certainly please you. The price here makes it tough to swallow.,
303,Tastes awful! : I am not sure why the other people said that this tastes good.... in my opinion it tastes awful! I would much rather not have a drink at all than drink this stuff.,

You can't always use it as a straight up exchange for Angostura, but a lot of times you can. It'll give your cocktail a whole different stir.But why stop at alcoholic drinks Use bitters in all kinds of beverages, both soft and hard.A few dashes of Peychaud's in your root beer or cola will transform it into something sublime. The usually muted vanilla and caramel aromatics will really burst forth.And the perfect hangover cure is lots of bitters and soda.Grab a bottle and don't let it get dusty on your shelf!",
564,The best! : I love a good champagne cocktail and this brand of bitters is MUCH better than the bitters found at the grocery store.,
565,"Great bitters. : I needed this to make my new favorite cocktail, (sazeracs) and it is a great product. Hard to find but leave it to Amazon to come through once again. The service and shipping was very fast also.",
566,"Need some for Sazeracs, great in Manhattans : If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need:Orange BittersPeach BittersLemon BittersOld Fashioned (Angostura-type) BittersPeychaud's BittersJaegermeisterCampariUnicumYou can't get Peychaud's bitters anywhere else...nothing else compares. I think its one of the most versatile bitters there is. Is great as a digestif, too. I like it more than Underberg's as a digestif.",
567,Excellent for making a Sazerac : A must for a Sazerac.-3 oz rye whiskey-3/4 oz simple syrup-Peychaud bitters to taste-absinthe or absinthe substitute-Lemon twist for garnish,
568,"Great product, but it may not be the one you are looking for : If you are looking for bitters for an old fashioned, manhattan, or any other drink that simply says bitters in the recipe, this is probably not what you want. Peychauds bitters taste very different than angostura bitters, as they have a character that tastes more like anise, absinthe, or black licorice. If that is indeed what you are looking for, for a drink such a sazerac, then you are in the right place. This bottle is 10oz, which is the larger size, and will indeed make many sazeracs.",
569,"Taste of Old New Orleans : Peychaud's Bitters is the defining ingredient in the classic New Orlean's cocktail known as the Sazerac, allegedly the first cocktail invented in the U.S., dating to the pre-Civil War period.As such, there's no substitute! It lends a mildly bitter taste and a sophisticated aroma to any beverage. In addition to mixing it for Sazeracs (check on line for various recipe versions), I add 7 - 10 drops to an iced glass of tonic or lemon-lime soda when I want a super-low-alcohol beverage with the taste of an alcohol cocktail. I find it soothes both the nerves and the digestive system.",
570,"Sazerac. Anything else : This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar. They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesn't show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping. Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size. I don't think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to Absinthe Cocktails by Kate Simon). I'll keep looking for other uses...",
571,"Sazarac Bar at Home : One doesn't need to travel to New Orleans for the perfect Sazarac. Make it with this ingredient, along with some good rye whiskey. This is also good in iced tea....mmmmm!",
572,"Must have : Adds a nice flavor to manhattans. Lots of flavor. I use Peychauds with other bitters in ice water for a great 0 calorie drink. Vary the amounts of each for a well rounded drink. Peychauds can be used alone because it has the high, medium and base flavor notes. Try it.",
573,"Adds more appeal to drinks : Good stuff, adds interest to many otherwise ordinary cocktails. I'm still experimenting with this one, but so far I've used it in many drink recipes it seems to go especially well with sweet drinks.",

The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. It's got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good.

703,"Great taste and texture : These traditional winegums are soft, gummy drops that are similar to but chewier than jujubes. Each piece is imprinted with the name of a type of alcohol such as Port, Rum, Gin, Cider, and Cognac. However, the candies are entirely non-alcoholic, and the flavors are actually lemon, apple, orange, raspberry, and black currant. The overall taste is pleasantly tart.",

I have been a consistent purchaser (by subscription, every 4 months) and these last order that came 2 weeks ago was different than all purchased previously - less sweet (they had been perfect) and harder texture which produced an overall less pleasing experience.

Well imagine my surprise when I recently opened my latest order to discover a new formula product that bears no resemblance to the old. The wine gums are smaller, harder, much paler in color, and all colors have this same wretchedly super-sweet after-taste that just keeps on giving me something that I definitely do not want.Why has Gustav begun shipping a different product with no advance notice to its loyal customers Well this is one former customer who is definitely no longer loyal! I'm stuck with 6.6kg. of these things and I'm seriously tempted to throw them in the garbage.Smarten up, Gustav's! Refund my money for this inferior garbage, or ship me what I ordered - the original product. I don't want this crap. And I'm betting nobody else does either.",

762,Just returned from Bermuda with some Stormy Ginger Beer. ... : Just returned from Bermuda with some Stormy Ginger Beer. Have to watch sugar intake so back at home I bought diet Stormy and did a side by side comparison. Confirmed the reviews that indicated that diet Stormy has noticeably less ginger flavor. I found a local source for Barritts diet ginger beer (made in Bermuda and preceded Gosling's ginger beer) and did a side by side comparison against diet Stormy. The diet Barritts had noticeably more ginger flavor.,
763,"Pricey here : Tastes great, hardly like diet. Great and intense ginger taste but expensive on this site I get it in the liquor store for about a buck a can.",
764,"Goslings inferior diet ginger beer : I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice. Although I highly doubt it, Goslings diet ginger beer may be the superior product for use in Dark n Stormy or Moscow Mule cocktails.",

766,"Disappointed : I bought this from a local store to make Moscow Mules, and I know Gosling's is more about the Dark and Stormy, but I have to say I was very disappointed in this product. It didn't have as strong of ginger bite as I was looking for, but I guess that's what I get for going diet. I will stick to Royals from now on.",

792,"Never judge a book by it's cover, because this Irish Red is amazing : I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. It's not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Red's.",

868,"Very Good, But Needs A Few Changes. : Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgil's Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us.

869,The BEST root beer ever. : Found this in a health food store and my son and I LOVED it! It is THE BEST tasting and healthy root beer ever! I am giving this as gifts to friends and family.,
870,"Good craft beer at a reasonable price! : I only stumbled upon this after reading it's apparently created by Walmart, it's a private label brand from what I read, not sure how true that is, but the taste was good all throughout, but I still have 2 or 3 left in the case to try, at a little less than a dollar per can, the price can't be beat, if you want to try something different lol....",False
871,Tequillas : need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better...,False
872,Plata : drink,False
873,good tequila for a fair price : Very good flavor without a over powering finish.. Never need salt or a lime but the addition of it makes it even better...one of my favorite silver tequilas,False
874,Would buy again : Use for shots.,False
875,Love me some Hornitos! : This is hands down my favorite tequila. Amazing taste at an amazing price. No lime salt needed.,False
876,"Stella Rosa Moscato D'Asti is the best white wine : I absolutely love this wine. With Moscato D'Asti being my favorite, I have tried several brands. Stella Rosa is my absolute favorite. I won't try any others. It's crisp and sweet with no icky aftertaste. I love it!",True
877,Yummy : Very good sweet moscato,True
878,Good tasting : tasted great twist OFF cap may easy to me If you put it down so it was knock down It Would Not Spill Out If You Have cap On Good a Very Good Idea Very Good Buy I Understood Some Towards Contributions Go Towards Veterans,True
880,"Not As Sweet : For those of you who want to enjoy a nice beverage that is not as sweet, try this mix. My husband has been purchasing this for some time now. Added to that, we pay the 50 yearly one time purchase to have future items from Walmart shipped to your home free. So worth the cost.",True
883,"functional, but not great : this didn't taste like olive juice from an actual jar of olives. it tasted a bit sweeter or like it was synthetic. i wouldn't recommend.",
884,"Best product I won't buy online again : I really like this product - it's the best out there. However, the combination of the occasional bad (mold) bottle, and the glass breakage/leaking, for the price point it's not worth the hassle. If I can buy it locally I will, otherwise I have to give up on Dirty Sue :-(",
885,A must buy. : Way better then using juice from the olives. Best martinis i have made yet.,
886,Never enough brine in the olive jar. . . : Great addition to my martini Monday . . .,
887,This stuff is the goods! : Absolutely perfect. Will reorder often.,
888,Makes a delicious martini : Really good stuff!!,
889,"Four Stars : Hubby says it's ok, but he prefers the olive juice in a jar of olives.",
890,Buy this for your bloody mary's! : Great for bloody mary's!,
891,Five Stars : great stuff!,
892,Four Stars : Very satisfied,
893,This stuff rocks! : I cant even drink a dirty martini anymore if I dont have Dirty Sue. I use a shot of it in Bloody Mary's too. There is no comparison to the juice found in olive jars... this stuff is like the top-shelf of olive brine. I highly recommend it!,
894,"Slurp.... aaaaaaahhhhhhh : I like martinis about as dirty as they can come. This stuff is just the bomb! It's so much more flavorful than any olive juice I've tasted from olives in a jar. It's full bodied, not just briny.Go ahead.... you're DEFINITELY worth it.!",
895,Mixer Madness : This is just what I have been looking for..as a lover of a good strong dirty martini I am known for having a refer full of juiceless olive jars. Dirty Sue was truly a find. I keep plenty of it stocked enough to share with my fiends and even those mere acquaintances that stop by.,
896,"Yum. : Delicious. I recently went through a dirty martini phase and was frustrated with the inconsistent quality of my drinks. Some were fabulous while others tasted outright disgusting. A waste of precious quality vodka. I quickly figured out that for me, only salt brines will do. No vinegar.I was discarding a lot of expensive olives for the sake of a few drinks and thought surely there must be a source for brine only. I read reviews and ingredient lists until finding Dirty Sue. This product ain't cheap (it's salt water after all) but I was not disappointed. Like I said before, NO VINEGAR. I'm very pleased. Will be purchasing several bottles for Christmas and pairing them with a nice Vodka as gifts.",
897,"Awesome stuff : If you want to make a good dirty martini, this is the stuff that is going to help you. It is the only Olive Juice my husband will take in his martinis and really the only one we ever have on hand always. Because we do entertain a lot, this gets bought often and is enjoyed by all.",
898,Best I've tried! : I have been a dirty martini drinker for years and I've never been able to find a good olive juice. Other brands claim to be 100 olive juice and they are really just glorified salt water. Dirty Sue is pure olive juice in a bottle. Or should I say pure magic in a bottle. I have a bottle of Dirty Sue in my fridge and a bottle of Ketel One in my freezer and I am a happy man.,
899,"AMAZING!!! : If you like dirty martini's, this is the only way to go! The tasteis outta this world and it's a superior juice than the stuff thatcomes in olive jars to preserve the olives. Ask for it at your local bar!!",
900,"Why couldn't I have thought of this! : This product is great! I am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in Hollywood, CA and I was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives. It's a huge waste of time, and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately. Once I discovered Dirty Sue, not only did it fix these problems, but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice. Let's face it, if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini, why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it",
901,If you really like 'em dirty... : It's a little too dirty but we used the whole bottle in a couple of weeks.,
902,"High quality, very good taste. Excellence martini mix. : Very tasty. Just the mix I was looking for, good quality.",
903,"Best martinit mix!!! : We have used other martini mixes, but this one is definitely the best. With a good vodka, the drinks are so smooth not bitter.",
904,"Five Stars : Very, Very Good",
905,Very good taste : Love this for my dirty martinis. The taste is very good.,
906,Five Stars : Great addition to dirty martinis,
907,Terrific! : Above and beyond!,
908,Dirty Sue Martini Mix : Super good!!!,
909,"Slurp.... aaaaaaahhhhhhh : I like martinis about as dirty as they can come. This stuff is just the bomb! It's so much more flavorful than any olive juice I've tasted from olives in a jar. It's full bodied, not just briny.Go ahead.... you're DEFINITELY worth it.!",
910,Five Stars : Have always loved Dirty Sue. Arrives on time and works great in martini's.,
911,Five Stars : it was everything I thought it would be and I would buy it again,
912,Five Stars : So Far Dirty Sue Martini Mix is the BEST we have ever used!!! :-),
913,Five Stars : Dirty Sue is the best mix for dirty martini's that I have found!,
914,makes the best dirty 'tinis : A staple that we now can't live without...makes the best dirty 'Tini's!,
915,If you like Dirty - Then Dirty Sue is for you! : My go to for Dirty Martini's and it should be yours..,
916,Good dirty mix. : Good dirty mix. A bit expensive so gave it 4 stars.,
917,Good stuff. : Just the right mix to make my dirty martinis dirty!,
918,A1 : I have tried every si gle kind of olive juice and have been extremely disappointed in all (even threw them out) in every case but Dirty Sue. This just can't be beat.,
919,Five Stars : GREAT.... TOO BAD IT ISN'T AVAILABLE LOCALLY..........,
920,Soooo Good! : This is the stuff. Delicious. I wanted to drink the bottle without the martini! I would definitely order thus again.,
921,"Yum. : Delicious. I recently went through a dirty martini phase and was frustrated with the inconsistent quality of my drinks. Some were fabulous while others tasted outright disgusting.

922,"Dirty Sues : Love it, but getting a little pricey. Order 1 18 oz instead of a 4 pack of 12 oz. May be making slightly less dirty martinis.",
923,Love it when you talk Dirty . : Dirty Sue. The perfect companion for the perfect Martini. Will never cheat on her. Highly recommend you give her a try. There's enough love to go around. .,

It is the only Olive Juice my husband will take in his martinis and really the only one we ever have on hand always. Because we do entertain a lot, this gets bought often and is enjoyed by all.",
925,A Central Ingredient! : It makes the biggest difference. I tried to use brine as a substitute - horrible taste. It's the real deal. A true mixer. Can't mix another Dirty Martini without it.,
926,"Makes A Great Dirty Martini : Good stuff, one of the two best (the other being Olive Squeezins from FL) you can find on the market.",

949,"Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water : My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendrick's Gin and it was good, better than Hendrick's in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.",
950,"I love Fever-Tree! : After doing an Internet search for tonic waters that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, I only found few options. The reviews for Fever-Tree were so positive that I decided to give it a try. They reviews are right: this tonic water is amazing! I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and T's, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, it's actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle. Schweppes is also FULL of sodium, and Fever-Tree is not. Check this tonic water out: you'll be glad you did!!",
951,"You don't smell it son, you drink it. : Man oh man, I love Fever Tree's Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didn't just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.There's a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. (1 Nephi 8:12)If you like it, you'll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesn't have it. Trader Joe's doesn't have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you! Let the sakura petals fall and the joy pebble dance commence!",
952,"This is such a painful review to write.......... : These were once the best Ginger Beers in the world. Nothing else even came close. I had been buying these by the case for years from Amazon (sometimes as many as 1-3 cases per month)! They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well. He said that it was obvious that the factory thought it was still making Tonic Water and let Quinine or whatever makes up tonic, run into these instead of natural spring water, as always used. That would explain the strange and unrecognizable bitterness. All I knew is that I was now stuck with three cases of stuff that tasted awful.I contacted Fever Tree directly to make them aware of this problem, as well as Brands Of Britain, who is the sole, authorized, distributor here in the United States.Read more",

They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well. He said that it was obvious that the factory thought it was still making Tonic Water and let Quinine or whatever makes up tonic, run into these instead of natural spring water, as always used. That would explain the strange and unrecognizable bitterness. All I knew is that I was now stuck with three cases of stuff that tasted awful.I contacted Fever Tree directly to make them aware of this problem, as well as Brands Of Britain, who is the sole, authorized, distributor here in the United States.Read more",

Any way, they are the BEST!",False

I don't like those other ones with the nooks and crannies. In New England, you can find this type in every grocery store, not necessarily the Cobblestone brand. It's hard to find this type in the south. Seems like they only sell Thomas's which are gross. Sometimes I can find these at Food Lion but my Walmart doesn't even have a spot on the shelf.",False

It would help if the outer box was labeled THIS SIDE UP !!",True
976,Bloody Marry Mx : I love this product and drink usually an 8 oz bottle daily with nothing in it but the mix. It is like Snappy Tom but I like it better. The last time I ordered a case of it and it is almost gone already. If you like a spicy tomato drink I highly recommend it.,False

978,"It's that easy!!! : Hi, this is Cocktail Artist Robert Porter. First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What I've done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes it's that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesn't have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create. Make the glass your canvas, mix it like you mean it. Robert.",False

I feel I will be expressing this to everyone I meet until the bitter end of my life. This mix... this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy ... is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream I need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends. It's that freaking good folks... buy it... buy cases of it... snort it, drink it, shoot it, whatever you do ... just try it! Once you do you'll be on here leaving another depraved review... hopefully three times more twisted than mine! God Speed. God Speed.",False

On a stressful day, I'll have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor.

I am retired and can't afford to buy one every 2 years but it looks like I will.,False
1037,"Not worth it. : If you're going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house, this is not worth the time or effort. The nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose.",False

I was looking for something inexpensive that would clean my driveway, grill and fence every so often. Yes, gas models are more powerful, but they're more expensive and you need to maintain them. First off - the build quality. Seems rugged. Metal couplings for hoses (vs plastic for my dad's old one). How well it does: Concrete was cleaned! The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean. Also had no issues cleaning my grill from 2 years of grease. Overall with a 2 year warranty I'm pretty happy with this!",False

1044,Absolutely love it! : I'm a woman who doesn't like to wait for her husband to help her do something. I can operate this by myself. I was surprised at how nicely it cleaned our composite decking. Our 40 year oldcement steps had green moss and black stains and I was able to clean they also. I used Scott's outdoor soap and can easily attach different nozzles and attachments. I hated our our gas power washer and we had much trouble with it. I hope this one lasts as it is a good value.,True

1053,Save your money : Bought last year and used once. Not strong enough to do much more than wash your car. Sprayer is plastic and not rugged. Sprayer ailed on me this year. Internal components rusted even though the washer was drained. Threaded connection to the sprayer is plastic. Cheaply made. Now junkyard.,False

1124,"Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita : Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.",

It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner.

1196,"Warm dark notes : The 'Burlesque' has a distinctive central flavor - I think it's walnut husk, aromatic and bitter in itself, and easy to pair with warm flavors. I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters I've tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper. Perhaps you get more repeatability and precision with a dropper, until the bottle runs low, but I prefer the convenience of a shaker, which you can find easily at Amazon.",

When I got it, I took out the dropper and dripped a little right on my tongue and instantly fell in love. It has the depth and complexity of flavor you expect from bitters, but it's not overwhelming. I love a glass of rum with just a couple dashes of this in it, or in an East India Trading Co. cocktail (with rum, sherry and amaro liqueur). I highly recommend.",

Tasted in person at a bitters bar at Oxbow Market in Napa and was excited to find easily on Amazon. A few drops in any tequila drink makes me happy - just a subtle hint of chocolate and heat. As I often use bitter/sour mixers less is more, or else it pushes the drink way too bitter. Will definitely buy again if I ever finish the bottle I have - a little goes a long way!",

1206,Five Stars : Great for a mole margarita like Tommy Bahamas makes.,
1207,Good based on your tastes : Only knock is for the actual taste which is not quite orange cream but a vanilla-vinegar orange rhine sort of taste. Depends on what you're going for in taste profile as I can see this easily matching some others' preferences for mixed drinks.,

1209,"Beware the foul plastic dropper rod : Dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off. Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one's drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermen's Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, it's disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material. Bittermen's, you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod.",
1210,"Warning: SHRUB VINEGAR : Just a friendly reminder: Shrub bitters are bitters that contain lots of vinegar. If the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you, then you may enjoy this. If it doesn't, then you do NOT want these.

1216,"Fast Shipping, great product. Limited uses. : I've had this for about 2 weeks now and I can't seem to find too many uses for it. Great in Gin martini type drinks and mellows out some harsher spirits in cocktails. Otherwise I can't really find too many recipes online or uses for it. Shipping and packaging is excellent.",
1217,"Interesting - wish it had a little more heat. : I bought this for one specific purpose - as an ingredient for a cocktail called Carter Beats the Devil . . . and, it works great. It's not quite as prominent of an ingredient as the chili tincture that the restaurant in San Francisco used, but it does the job - just wish it had more punch per drop.I've used it quite a bit - and, since it is measured in drops, it'll probably last me forever.I am interested now in trying more of Bittermens bitters . . . glad I bought this one.",
1218,"Delicious : I love all sorts of bitters, but this one is a favorite of mine, it has a complex flavor with hints of cardamom and clove and also exotic fruits. I like it in grapefruit, gin and sodas, and also in Jack and Cokes. Makes a great Manhattan!",

1234,Not too spicy it is just perfect. Experiment to fit your taste : Interesting flavor to add to summer refreshments. Not too spicy it is just perfect. Experiment to fit your taste.,
1235,Best chocolate bitters I've found : I love chocolate bitters in a Manhattan. The full flavor of these bitters balances nicely with the richness of Carpano Antica--not everything does and you need a Rye with some kick to bring it all together.,
1236,"Excellent cocktail flavoring : This stuff has just the right amount of heat - enough to be worth using, but not so much that you can make your cocktails undrinkable without effort. I put it in any cocktail that needs a little bite, and have been happy with the results.",
1237,"The Perfect Bitters : Not wanting alcohol on an outing with colleagues but wanting something that has taste, I ordered club soda with bitters.

1238,"Two drops : Two drops in a gin vermouth martini is just about perfect. Good stuff. Luckily, it comes with a dropper...",

1240,"Not as hot as I wanted. : This doesnt put out the heat I wanted. To get a good bite you add so much it effects the flavor of the drink.It's not terrible. But a chopped jalapeo can get just as much if not more heat , with a better flavor.",
1241,"Bright (not bitter) celery flavor for drinks! : While Bittermens primarily makes various kinds of bitters for making drinks -- this one is not technically bitters, but a tart shrub -- especially good for adding to Bloody Marys, and an amazing Bloody Shrimp Martini. I'm sure you could make a good drink in the traditional shrub recipes -- but a dropper of this really brightens up even the most plain-jane Bloody recipe with a shot of liquid celery flavor.

1244,One of my favorite bitters! : Mixology has become a passion of mine--I'm known in my friend circle for making GFC's (Good F'n Cocktails!). Bittermens Hellfire is one of my secret ingredients. It adds just the right subtle heat to anything I make.I've carefully selected over a dozen really top-notch hand-crafted bitters to add just the right extra something to my cocktails. These folks have created one of the very best bitters out there. (Thank you!),
1245,Great! : adds great flavor to any beverage. I suggest trying it with vodka or gin. Looking forward to using it in a drink with dark liqueur.,
1246,"Amazing stuff : So the Habanero Bitters are great in a version of a Margarita we do that traditionally used tabasco. I like this at least as much and you don't get any of the vinegar flavor one does from Tabasco.Also, LOVE the tiki bitters and a bitter monk is my new favorite cocktail just because I get to use this in it.Great stuff.",
1247,"Just wish it hadn't spilled in shipping : These bitters are great and the dropper bottle is an easy way to use th estuff in all kinds of cocktails.

Simple Syrup1 Lemon Twist2 Dashes of Peychaud's Bitters30 Drops of Bittermens Habanero Bitters (Start with 20 and increase from there, it gets hot!)Serve it on ice",
1250,"Amazing : This was out of stock almost everywhere and I nabbed the last one on Amazon. It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regan's, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regan's, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.",

1252,"For some burn in your booze : Subtle and slow building.Great with Citrus and flavorful bases, like anejo tequila, gin, or golden rum.Bittermens makes some of the most unique bitters.",
1253,"Delicious in a Mojito : I mentioned to the bar tender that the secret ingredient in a Mojito was a couple of drops of bitters. He did not have the Angostura bitters so we tried the Bittermens Hopped Grapefruit Bitters. All I can say is Ay, caramba!The bitters gave the Mojito a very refreshing taste!",
1254,Exquisite taste sensation! : This flavor of bitters is quite unique! There is a subtle warmth and profound chocolate flavor that is haunting. We like it in a tequila-based coffee liqueur. Add half a shot of good scotch and you have a drink worthy of the finest company you know...,
1255,"Bitters complimentary to Tropical drinks : For any Tikiphile out there, these are a great addition to any tropical drink recipes. I substitute them in place of Angostura bitters in Zombies, Rum Barrels and 151 Swizzles. They may be a bit niche in their application, but it's a wonderful product nonetheless.",

1434,"Don't waste your calories : Actually, the Great Value crescent rolls in my area's Walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing ... plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls. Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.",False
1435,"Horrible! : If I could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating, I would! I would even give it a negative star. Of course, whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can, you expect a POP! Well, nothing happenedat first. I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase. From now on, I know to go with a more reputable brand.",False
1436,"These have to be opened and rolled cold. : I bought three of these for the first time to make a new breakfast casserole. One package was opened right after taking them out of the fridge and was the bottom of the casserole. The second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole. It was useless and had to be thrown away. It was a ball of sticky, gooey, unshapable dough. Into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand. We had one pack left that I just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand. My little ones even had seconds. I think that the fact that they were still really cold when I opened the package and put them on the cookie sheet really helped.",False
1437,Great Value Great Product - Works as expected. : This is a good product and it works as expected. I am not sure why so many reviews are there criticizing it. You are buying a dough and you got to mold it as you need.. not sure being flaky and all is a valid critic for this product... it holds shape as it should and bakes nicely...It tastes good and nice... This worked just as planned and I was able to make rolls as planned..!!!! Will recommend !!! Thank you walmart !!!,False
1438,"Very difficult to use : First off, I could not get the package open. Then, when I opened it, there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents. I had to break off bits of dough, roll them in my hands, and make drop biscuits. Terrible!",False
1439,"Impossible to make crescent rolls' with : These were terrible!!! It seems like they are just crammed into the packaging. There is no way to roll them out into triangles. It just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them. I ended up having to roll it all out and make my own! Too much work! Next time I will be spending the extra 0.30 or so and going with Pillsbury!! Heck, I'd even pay 5.00 more to not deal with this garbage!",False
1440,"Absolutely useless : First, let's establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents. Hence crescent rolls. These are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls. The dough stuck together would not unroll. Where I needed triangles, I came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough. It was 100 useless for the recipe I was making. I was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these.",False

I have ordered one of every wine they sell to compare with the higher priced 6 week kits i normally get. I'll be submitting reviews on those wines once I taste them.",

I started the kit 2 days ago and added one cup of medium toast american oak, half a can of frozen concentrate grape juice, and some blanched raisins with dates. I added water to 5.25 gallons and got a specific gravity of 1.095. It smells great, and fermentation is in high gear. I expect I will rack twice (week 2 6) and bulk age for several months before bottling. I am quite satisfied so far. Thanks to ABC Cork Co. and Amazon for this wonderful kit.",

1461,"Very good low cost wine kit! : I have made over 60 wine kits over the last 4 years. This kit performed as well as any of the other kits. I bought the Merlot Fontana Wine kit and added about a cup of oak chips and about 3/4 cup dried elderberries which I do with all my Merlots. At 4 weeks I stabilized and put in the clarifiers. As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor. I expect to bottle and age this for no less than 6 months, at which time I believe it will be a very good tasting wine. Thanks to Fontana and Amazon for supplying us with a low cost, good tasting wine kit. Hoping they add more varietals at this price in the near future.",

1463,"Delicious Summer Mai tai Coctail Mix : I was so happy to have located Mr Mrs T Mai Tai Mix at Wallmart on-line. It is nearly impossible to find it in NJ (grocery or liquor stores). Usually, I am not a fan of any bar drink mixes, particularly now sugary ones, but this one is a fabulous concoction! Not too sweet, the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour, with a touch of bitter almonds. Just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing Baccardi Rum garnish with Maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple (on a skewer). I have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer :) Had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors. We are hooked! Wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable SH charge.

I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.",False

1509,"Greattt BUT : It looks great. A real attention piece in our kitchen. Tons of space. I removed the lower rack and have some sodas, other various drinks from time to time.... my only and bigest issue with this is that I can never get the temperature down past 51. If that's okay for you, this is a great cooler. My wife likes her wine cold and in an ideal situation temp would be 41-44 degrees. This is not capable of that no matter how long you leave it on. One more thing, everytime you open the door even if it's for a matter of seconds you will see a temperature rise of about 3 degrees. Foolishness. Great for the price but that's it.",
1510,Worth the low price. : Didn't have any reviews when I bought it so I just paid the extra cash for the Assurion insurance. I really like this thing. Sleep and stylish looks really good in my living room for my expensive beer collection that I wanted to cellar. I don't think you can cellar anything where I live in SoCal so this helped out a lot. On the lower levels of the temp range the fan is pretty loud. If you can handle that then you will be OK.,
1511,Two Stars : Never gets cold enough.,
1512,"So far so good : We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, won't have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so don't put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we won't have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.",
1513,"Love this Wine Cellar : Excellent Wine Cellar, doesn't take up much space. It's quiet when running and seems to maintain the temperature you set it. This is only the case if you don't have a power outage in your area. It will default to 66 degrees when the power returns.",

1515,"otherwise it seems to be working pretty well. : Didn't get 5 stars because it doesn't spare any room for bottles that are a little longer. They should redesign for a little extra room, otherwise it seems to be working pretty well.",
1516,"very happy so far : We received this two days ago in perfect condition. so far I am very satisfied. The unit looks great, operates fairly quietly, and is maintaining a perfect 55 degrees for our good reds. i only have 55 bottles in it so I have not tested the full capacity. the only con so far is that we have a few fatter than normal bottles that did not fit on certain shelves and some taller bottles that did not fit on the bottom shelves because of the compressor behind. But these are minor annoyances.",
1517,Met expectations : Slightly noisier than I'd prefer but quiet enough to have just outside a bedroom. Bottles fit nicely. The unit doesn't take up too much space but holds good amount. Overall pleased after 2 months of use.,

1566,"This makes a great syrup for pancakes and waffles! : I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy.

1567,This has hit bottom--used to be great : Until recently (Spring 2012)Mr MRS T's Original tasted like a tomato juice based scrumptous blody-mary mix. My wife and I enjoyed it. Now the original is made with high fructose cord syrup and no loger even tastes like it has a tomato juice base. I will no longer purchase this bastardized concoction.,
1568,"Very good alone! : I actually like this alone, without any vodka! Tomato juice is good, but I love the spiciness of this mix even better. The cans make it portable (I carry them as a snack at work), and although I'm disappointed that Mr. Mrs. T has apparently discontinued the 11.5 oz size I used to buy, this size works for me, too.",
1569,Great taste and reasonable size : I keep these on hand for my aging mother in assisted living as she likes a little spice in her snacks. These taste very good and are small enough for a quick snack between meals. I also use them in soups and stews to enrich the broth. They even make a great quick cup of soup by themselves when microwaved and topped with some grated cheese. Very nice product.,
1570,"Better than the bottle : I developed an appreciation for this drink during my days of frequent airline travel. I prefer to drink them straight (without booze). As a result, I started buying bottles of the mix at the grocery store--because finding this by the can in the real world is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, when you buy this by the bottle something happens. The first glass tastes exactly as you expected. But once you open the bottle, if you don't drink the contents within 24-36 hours the taste turns. Keeping a stock of cans in the house, therefore, is essential. I live in a major metropolitan area and I can't find these cans in any store. Not grocery stores (including mom pop, big chains, high-end small chains, etc), not liquor stores (including corner stores or BevMo). Enter Amazon. I'm very grateful I can buy this by the can here on the interwebs. I personally prefer the smaller-size cans to the 11.5 ounce. Make sure to buy enough to qualify for super saver shipping.",

Truth is, I drink this because it's an extremely tasty Tomato Juice Cocktail! No alcohol necessary. Much tastier than V-8. Try it! You could even add alcohol, if it pleases you.",
1574,"Very Good Bloody Mary Mix - Highly Recommended! : Mr Mrs T's Bloody Mary Mix is our favorite off-the-shelf Bloody Mary mix and these 5.5oz cans are very convenient. We use the less expensive larger bottles if we know our guests will be having Bloody Marys but like these cans for single servings since the larger bottles need to be refrigerated after being opened.We add a little more than 1oz of Vodka (your taste may vary) and find that it really doesn't need anything else for most people. It is just spicy enough for my wife, but I put an extra shot of Tabasco Sauce in mine and my mother cuts hers with a little tomato juice to dilute the heat a little. These are also good straight (without any spirits added) and as substitute for tomato juice in cooking (particularly vegetable stock) to add an extra zing to your dishes.The 24 can case is a good value (especially if you have Prime or qualify for free Super Saver shipping) since we could only find them in smaller packs locally and at a much higher price per can.Highly Recommended!CFH",
1575,"Aromatic : To compare with other orange bitters: these are more aromatic-tasting and have more of a real orange zest flavor than Fee's orange, which are more of a candy orange flavor, though they differ from Angostura orange, which taste more like Angostura aromatic bitters mixed with Fee's orange bitters. This is not to say that it is better different cocktails work better with the other two. I find that a dash of these ones turns an otherwise decent sidecar into an incredible one.",
1576,"better bitters : Regan's Orange Bitters No.6 is not only a wonderful flavor for mixed drinks but makes water, yep plain ol' water, taste fabulous!Purchased 3 bottles knowing that at least 2 of them will make wonderful stocking stuffers.",
1577,"Best Orange Bitter : I've tried 5 other orange bitters, and I like this one the best. Not too sweet or citrus intensive (like Angostura). A little bit of a spice like flavor to compliment the orange. Works perfect in my Cherry Manhattan -- 3 parts Wild Turkey Rye, 1 part Herring Cherry liqueur, 2 dashes of Regan's, 2 Merry Maraschino cherries and a spoon of cherry juice from the cherry jar. So goooooood!",
1578,"My favorite orange bitters : In my opinion, this is the best all around orange bitters on the market. It has a very bitter, but complex flavor profile. For a lighter, more citrusy orange bitters, try Fee brothers west indian. But Regans adds more depth to most (though not all) cocktails.",
1579,"Going through a bitters period. : Regan's Orange Bitters 6 is just as advertised. Intense and very potent, it will give your Manhattan or Old Fashioned a real kick in the pants. I want to experiment using it with Crepes Suzette or Grand Marnier cakes - it should intensify and enhance quite well. In addition: If you have not tried Fee Brother's Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters or Peychaud's Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - then you have not experienced what bitters can do for your cocktails - or vanilla ice cream - for that matter! I am afraid that the old stand-by Angostura just doesn't compare - and I like Angostura very much!",
1580,"The best bitters I've found : These orange bitters are very flavorful and, unlike several other brands, are not overly sweet. They are excellent in any of the dryer liquors. I always seek this product out over others of this type.",

1582,"Your Secret Ingredient : Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail. Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails. After doing extensive research I learned that Regan's made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product). Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regan's however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you don't get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you won't be disappointed. Go to Regan's website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters. You'll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini.",
1583,"Not ready for prime time : I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regan's. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.",
1584,"An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name : I think it's fair to say that Angostura's ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged. And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch. I am a huge fan of Regan's orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angostura's offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange. Brilliant. I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesn't",
1585,"A Dash of Brilliance from Angostura : Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor! I haven't yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold.",
1586,"Nice product but price a head scratcher : Angostura Orange Bitters is now the third product in a tiny little product niche that includes long-standing stalwart Fee Brother's and Regan's No. 6. Since the traditional Angostura Bitters (essential ingredient in Manhattan and Pegu Club cocktails) is an institution that has extremely wide distribution, this product is piggybacking off the older product's brand recognition and iconic status. So why does this product cost 9.95 for 4 oz. when Regan's No. 6 costs 6.26 for 5 oz. and Fee Brothers costs 6.99 for 5 oz. The answer is that price probably doesn't matter if you've got the distribution. How many bottles of orange bitters you gonna go through this year, BippyBuy Amazon's 3-pack with one bottle of each brand, and you'll be set -- and confused -- for life.Angostura Orange Bitters happen to be very good.",

They work fine, but if you are using them for this purpose you should know they have a plastic liner. I didn't see that in the description and didn't think about it till thy were received. You can peel off the liner but it's a nuisance. Also, I use a Sizzix Big Kick to flatten. At first they were going complete flat and distorted into ovals. After several frustrating attempts, I realized I was using an extra shim from a previous project. If you use just the base plate and the 2 cutting plates, they will turn out perfectly.

1620,"Mildly spicy mustard : This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. I've tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood I'm in and what I'm putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesn't have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug. As a home brewer I've often thought it would be nice to have a mug like this when I wanted to sample my beer.",

The date code on the side of the lid is worn off where I cannot read the month or day...only the year, which is 2013. The price at 8.49 is about 5-6 too high. I have found it at MyBrands, which is the importer's site for public sale, at 2.25 and elsewhere for 3 and up. I think the 8.49 price has the free shipping built in.

I've had a variety of whites and have tried to find something that I could have with a nice meal or alone (I am not a fan of white wines), but this one was perfect! Definitely could have a glass of this alone while reading a good book.",

Thinking of making art out of them. I am an artist and would love to design something for wine bottles. :) Maybe I better go have another glass now! Thank you Barerfoot Cellars!",

2731,Worth every penny and more One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No : I enjoyed reading the wine label and descriptions on the back of the bottle as much as drinking this wine. My favorite line was something about the mission of the company to save marriages.,

2736,"Nice wine : I got the rose. Very good. Not too sweet but mellow. I'm not a big wine drinker, it this is the best I drank in a long time. I'm going to order more. I should have ordered with tsv.",
2737,"Dreadful : I bought the rose as they said it was sweetIt turned out to be tasteless and really dry, nasty!Also took over a week to get hereI am tired of how long it takes packages to arrive",
2738,"not the best : I have purchased this wine with various cheaper brands and have liked it FAR more. Seemed very sour to me. Not mellow at all. PLUS, they did not mention that you need to sign for this wine during the presentation. Just they now deliver to PA. I found this out while tracking . My luck I was home the day of delivery. Will go to the local state store for my regular brand.",
2739,Too Sweet! : I was so happy to see Rose lincluded in this set instead of sweet Zinfandel. Unfortunately this rose was sweeter than Zinfandel. Very disappointed!,
2740,"Worth Exactly What I Paid... : This wine is not great, in my opinion. I know wine taste is subjective, and this is only my opinion. But to me the wines are harsh, not smooth. An $8 taste, not $20 like hosts claimed. I'll drink it, will not gift it as I had hoped to, and have cancelled my auto delivery. I bought the mixed box so I've tried them all...",
2741,Found To Be Poor : Wish this could be a positive review but not this time.Found the reds to be lacking greatly in aroma (nose) and both with an unpleasant finish.Usually we have been pleased overall with the wines but this is a definite miss for us.,
2742,"Ok, but not what I was looking for. : It my quest to find an equivalent to Stoney's Ginger Beer that is only available in South Africa, this wasn't exactly what I was searching for, but wasn't bad. It didn't make a whole lot either, which was a bummer. Given the trouble of having to by carbonated water and mix it up, I would probably go with another option.",
2743,"Moscow Mule : Bought this to make Moscow Mules and and following the directions on the bottle for mules, it made great ones. Suggest that you fizz it up with bubble water.",
2744,"Delicious! : I love this stuff! So versatile - great for tea, hot wing sauce, salad dressing ingredient and what it's supposed to be used for - ginger beer. You can even mix that up a bit, too -- I use flavored La Croix soda water (lime, lemon, grapefruit) and that's great too. They label this medium spicy - I'd love to see a spicier version.The great thing about this syrup is that you can make your ginger beer as sweet or as dry as you'd like. I bought this originally as a one-time purchase, but next time I'll be a subscribed purchaser. It's a must have for me.",

2759,"Decent wines that help out some great causes! : I have tried the Cabernet and the Merlot. When I received these I followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping, and then to open and let sit in order to breathe. I felt the Cabernet was still to young, it had a very strong bite to it. I don't consider myself an expert, but I know a wine I like and have been taught a lot and am still learning. The Merlot on the other hand was much better! It was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins. I would continue buying this one. I have not tried the Pinot Noir yet. I'm hoping this will be just as satisfying as the Merlot was. I will add to my review once I've opened the bottle. And most of all I love how this company takes some of the proceeds and gives them to wonderful causes. That alone is worth buying this!",

Well I LOVED all of them, even though I am not a huge fan of pinot noirs. I really like that this company donates a percentage of each wine purchased to a different charity. The company is all about sustainability and giving back. One Hope is a company with a cause, AND outstanding wine. There is just so much to love about this wine!",

2766,"Disappointing. Sweet! : I almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines. We pretty much couldn't even drink them because they are so sweet, thick and jammy. Like fruit juice. We started with the Pinot Noir and after a few sips, aerating and then a few more sips with dinner, we just poured it out. It did not resemble any Pinot I've had before. So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I haven't tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned. Unfortunately, I that's not an option since they are open and mail order. Maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking. I do love that this producer gives back to charities, more companies should follow their lead in that respect.",
2767,"A new favorite : Wine by mail! And such good, full-bodied reds. I will buy again.But along the way, I need a new corkscrew. My serviceable current one struggles with the tight-packed corks. Makes sense who wants leaky wine And re-corking is no cinch, either.I have wandered among the corkscrews sold on Amazon, and have no idea how to choose. If you have a suggrstion, please leave it in comments. Thanks!",

The pinot was a little on the light side for me but as someone mentioned earlier, open and let sit for a while. It's definitely better. The cab is my favorite and I would purchase again. I shared the merlot with a merlot fan and they liked it a lot. Since part of the proceeds go to various charities its worth the purchase.",

2773,"One of my favorite big reds. Jammy, fruit forward, lush, berries. One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No : One of my favorite big reds. Jammy, fruit forward, lush, berries. Not too sweet (for our taste), tannic (in a good way). I alternate at the moment on a daily basis between Apothic Dark and Gnarly Head Authentic Black. Both selling for 6.99 at Ralphs. (Why would anyone buy online and pay double)",
2774,"Pleasant surprise! Very pleasant. : Wow! I wanted a different kind of wine to serve to friends. Unfortunately (for them) I opened the bottle of Apothic Dark before anyone arrived so I could taste it. By the time they showed up, there wasn't much of the Apothic left to share. Oops. They got the regular wine. This is now by far my favorite wine. By the way, if you like a sweet tickle pink kind of wine, this one is not for you.",
2775,"it smelled like espresso at breakfast : I am not a fan of red wines. But I study nutrition and am learning about the health benefits of dark red wines. I got this at Trader Joe's with fingers crossed. When I opened the bottle, it smelled like espresso at breakfast. I found that odd, but I love coffee, so it gave me hope that I would like it. Sipping this delicious beverage was like warm berries on a summer day. This wine is straight up comfort food. Sublimely satisfying",
2776,"Five Stars : If you like blends, this is very good.",
2777,"One of Our Favorites : This is currently one of our favorite wines! We've even recommended it to friends. It's moderately sweet without to much dryness at the end. The cork is actually black, which we thought was a nice touch.",
2778,"Deep Rich Excellent : Love this deep rich but not sweet wine. My first taste was few months ago while visiting relatives in Copperhill, Tennessee. I was surprised with the wonderful, smooth taste and flavors, and happy to learn it was a California wine. Upon returning to Calfornia I ordered a case and shared this delicious hearty smooth wine with friends. Apothic also makes a red wine that is not dark, it to is a smooth flavorful wine but not as rich and deep as the dark, it goes great with everything or nothing. Enjoy, Christina",
2779,"Good Cabernet Sauvignon : Based on reading some of the reviews here, I considered canceling my order. I'm very glad I did not! I just received my first shipment, and I have to say I am really enjoying this Cabernet Sauvignon. I'm very glad I signed up for auto-ship!",
2780,Disappointing : I realize this is an inexpensive bottle of wine but it is tasteless. Will not buy wine from QVC again.,
2781,Great wine : This is one of the best Chards that I have had in a long time. Very light and delicious. I have ordered another wine from qvc and this is the best yet. I am on automated ordering and I also changed it to every 60 days. You will not be disappointed.,
2782,"LOVE : I'm not a wine expert, I'm a novice, but this wine is delicious! So glad I ordered autoship!",

2784,Great Wines! : We've always had good luck with Smoking Loon and these wines were no exception. Very flavorful.,

2787,"Decent : I have tried the cab and it is acceptable for what I wanted - an after work glass of wine. Put the Pinot away as it is way too young to drink. The rose was refreshing. I have not tried the Chardonnay yet. This group of wines worked for me in that 1) it was about the price of grocery store wine, 2) it was delivered to my house, and 3) I get to try a variety of wines that I normally would not purchase. I marked that I would not recommend this as a gift only because everyone's palate is different - I do not usually give wine as a gift.",
2788,"Great Wine for all food types or by itself! : I have been waiting for this bundle. As the presentation indicated the Rose is not that over bearing sweet, just in the middle and therefore I can enjoy it also, along with the delicious Pino Noir my favorite and the Chardonnay. These are delicious with a meal, by themselves or with cheese - as David says, everything is better with cheese.. I have on Auto- delivery. I wish I could pre-order for next year too.. Very Smooth wine. Everything they said in the presentation with David and other hosts are spot ON! I am enjoying this bundle and you will too.. Thank you QVC and Vintage Wine Estates. Sincerely,",
2789,"WINES were TERRIBLE, QVC was GREAT!! : I bought 2 of the wine collections; one in the mixed of white & red and one in the all reds. The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!! No hassles, questions, etc... just immediately refunded the 2 payments I already made. While the wines disappointed, QVC did not! Thank you QVC, this is exactly why I will remain a loyal shopper!!",
2790,"Very disappointed : I consider myself a wine lover but I’m not a wine snob. I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites. After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case. You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Lessons learned in this case.",
2791,"Disappointed : Got this for the nice variety it offered. Rose is nice, not too sweet not too dry. Pinot noir is average, nothing special or outstanding and I wouldn’t get it again. Chardonnay is awful— maybe just the bottle we opened, but it immediately smelled spoiled and tasted the same. Wound up pouring it down the drain and hoping the next two bottles aren’t rotten as well. Have not tried the Cab yet as it’s my favorite type of wine and I hate to be disappointed—hoping we’ll be two for four at least. Sorry to say next time I’ll pass...",
2792,"Best purchase for the price : We are still sampling each one - so far favorite is the Chardonnay, but that can change",
2793,"TASTY TASTY : I just received my collection. I opened the Rose and it was very tasty. This Rose is not overly sweet and that was my main concern. It has a light fruity taste and pairs well with cheeses. I haven't tasted the others yet, but this is a great deal for the quantity you receive. I will continue to update as I open the others.",

2798,O'Leary Reds : I bought a case of his reds 6/6 from QVC right before Christmas. I was extremely disappointed with my purchase as were my dinner guests. It is always better to sample a wine before making a purchasing. A lesson learned.,

2801,Meritage is perfect blend : I like full bodied but smooth red. The meritage is a perfect blend of the things I love in red wine. Have alternated lately between a Pinot noir and Cab. This is delicious and perfectly priced.,
2802,"3 cheers for ""Mr. Wonderful"" : I knew that Kevin O'Leary loved good wine. Well, let me tell you, he also makes some delicious wine. I purchased the 3-bottle Chardonnay and it is Wonderful. I'm no wine expert, but I know what I like. I enjoy white wine but I don't like sweet, which is why I didn't try the Moscato. I like to enjoy a nice glass of white wine whenever I feel like it. This wine is delightful by the glass - no food necessary. I'm very pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that I purchased it on auto-delivery. I can't wait for my next shipment! I highly recommend this wine. Mr. Wonderful will not let you down!",
2803,"BEST RED!!! : I have ordered wines from O'Leary before. I love red wine. But THIS red wine is AWESOME!!! More smooth than Cabernet, and Cab is usually my FIRST choice. That was OK but THIS THIS THIS one ... Auto Delivery for sure!!!!",
2804,"Totally surprised! : Bought the wine for my son for a Christmas present. Was very skeptical at first. First, I myself really don't care for wine. Leaves a nasty after taste and bitter to me, plus after drinking 1 glass of red, I wake up with a severe headache. Well anyway my son open a bottle, I had ordered all red. I went over to see if I could with stand the smell. Totally surprised I could, so I decided to try it. Very smooth, no after taste. Not a strong, bitter smell. Had guests over for New Year's eve and they had enjoyed it just as much as I did and my son. Probably will be ordering again.",
2805,Not so great blends : Disappointed with the taste and consistency of these wines. My husband and I were looking forward to sharing them with friends on Christmas Eve. We tried the four variety to be fair and were not satisfied planning to send the rest back.,
2806,"Pleasantly Surprise : I too was skeptical on ordering wines on line. I figured Meh... I love wine how bad could it be..... I was surprised... Very Smooth, flavorful with a beautiful nose.",
2807,"Pleasantly Surprised! : I was a little skeptical about purchasing wine from QVC, but I've been very surprised by the quality of this wine collection. I ordered the mixed-auto delivery package. The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like you'd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that I'm a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin O'Leary's Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). I'm so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I can't wait to see what I get in the Spring. Very good wine, Mr. O'Leary.",
2808,Good wine : I belong to other clubs but bought this because of the free shipping. I do NOT like Rose wine and was sure I'd hate it but.......it is excellent. A slight sweet taste very slight. It is a little effervescent too. I forgot where I bought it and googled it to buy more . It runs 75.00 for 3 bottles! Not expensive but not 5.00 a bottle either. I have not had the others but I am anxious to taste them....,
2809,"Mediocre : You get what you pay for, I got it for $8.25 a bottle and that's about all it is worth. I should of known better. but it's free s&h,. I was disappointed it's all from the same vintner and not as the labels show different wineries. It was just the ease of delivery. I live in California and have so many options of good wines. One and only purchase. Q does not know good wines!",
2810,Our friends loved it!!! : We had four friends over tonight for dinner. They loved this wine! Hands down the Mascato was the favorite! There were no complaints about the Chardonnay at all but the first choice was the Mascato! They were very excited to find out that more was on the way with auto delivery!,

I bought an assortment of wines for a house warming party last weekend and these were great. White cat was like a Sweet Mascoto, Cabin Fever had a sweet taste all it own, I Red Cat was also sweet, I don't care for red wine but this was good! The Breathable Berry reminded me of a Sangria.This brand is on the top of my list, I will buy more of their wines!",

2826,Four Stars : Great wine and price,
2827,Five Stars : Loved every bottle. Will order again.,
2828,"All great, amazing value. : Red cat is my favorite wine of all time.The Red Cat itself is sweet but not too much so, with a little tartness.The White Cat is light and refreshing especially ice cold, same goes with the Cabin Fever.The best out of the 4 in my opinion though is Bramble berry. Tart, sweet and tastes like berry jam. I love it!",
2829,"dissolves easily : This product is just as described, easy to measure for this beginner. It dissolves easily and fermentation halts in 48 hours just as stated. I feel safe sweetening my wine and bottling without worrying about bottle bombs. Great price and shipped very quickly, no complaints.",
2830,Good product! Great quantity. : Nice quantity and nice price. I would have liked it more if it came in a re sealable bag. Shipping bag is hot sealed so you have to repack or store in another sealed container and relabel after opening for use. That was kind of a Hassle but the product works fine and did exactly what it said and I wanted.Fast shipping and Undamaged delivery.,
2831,Potassium Sorbate : I use this to stabilize my home brew wine after fermentation before back sweetening and bottling to prevent reactivated fermentation. Works great,
2832,"GOOD STUFF : WORKED GOOD FOR MY WINE MAKING, GOOD STUFF.",

2836,5 Stars : Good Quality. Worked as needed!,
2837,Nicely done. Wine tastes good and the chocolate that ... One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No : Nicely done. Wine tastes good and the chocolate that comes in the packing is delicious. They could have however printed the brand name in a smaller font on the glass. The current font size is too large to be used when inviting guests.,
2838,The gift set was beautiful and a lot for the price One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No : I had to chase down delivery since you have to sign for it. Not an issue. The gift set was beautiful and a lot for the price. I purchase this for my boss who is leaving the company. She loved it. I would buy this again definitely! Naked Winery just gained a new customer.,
2839,"Naked Cab is by far one of my favorite red wines out there : Naked Cab is by far one of my favorite red wines out there. Woody with depth and complexity and notes of black currant, this is one fabulous wine! I love that this gift set is all inclusive - a big dark chocolate bar and 2 very nice wine glasses. Your recipient will think you spent a fortune on this gift box! Comes very nicely packaged in a black box, festive crinkle and tissue paper fill and fun things like a bumper sticker and tattoos. Great buy! Love this set!",
2840,"Good value : I purchased two of these as holiday gifts. The price seemed just right for a bottle of wine, glasses and chocolate. In fact, even without glasses, this would've been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I can't speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let's get naked referring I'm sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that. I feel a bit embarrassed now as I hope the recipients don't confuse my intentions. Fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had I sent this to someone more conservative in my life, I would have been so very, very embarrassed.",
2841,"Perfect date night gift! : Cabernet and chocolate. Win Win! This wine is such an easy drinking cab that it is hard not to buy it any time it's available, let alone when it is on special. Combine it with glasses and some chocolate My date night is made!",
2842,"Tastes like a 40+ Cabernet Sauvignon - Not an Oaky Fruit Bomb. : This wine is the best cab for the money I've ever had. Sometimes a 10 cab tastes like a 20 cab, and that's a bargain wine for sure. This Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Naked Winery drinks like a 40+ cabernet. So try it now! This is not a fruity oak bomb, nor a lengthy, earthy, subtle cab.Here are my 2-liner tasting notes:Black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate. Medium tannins. An elegant, smoky barrel toast on the finish.",
2843,"Would recommend this for a gift for red wine lovers! One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No : Bought this for my daughter-in-law, she loved it.",
2844,Love the winery : Bought this for sis-in-law's birthday. Love the winery!!,
2845,"do not order : I will never order again! ""Two buck Chuck"" has better taste!",
2846,"Great Deal : The wine was excellent ordered the Moscato, and auto delivery. Second order I switched to White Zinfandel it was delicious also.",
2847,We Love This Moscato : We ordered 6 bottles of the Moscato on auto delivery. So glad we did. It's different but we love it.,
2848,Very good flavor : Very good! Nice flavor. Receiving Reds on auto-delivery.,
2849,"LOVE THE WINE : I am originally from France love red wine I didn't think I will love it but as a surprise, it's a great wine for the price I recommend you gave Kevin.s wine a try",
2850,"Excellent Purchase : Delivery was a little slow but it was worth the wait. I was very pleased with the Moscato selection. It arrived in excellent condition, which indicates it was well packaged. The price was very reasonable.",
2851,"Wine Tasting : I have tried this wine before, but this batch was not good at all and I will never order again.",
2852,"Great Moscato : Knowing that wine taste varies, have to say I really enjoy the Moscato. I find it very refreshing, with a great flavor. I chose the auto-delivery, and share with my sister, who also enjoys and looks forward to when the next delivery is due.",
2853,"Good Chardonnay : I've only tried the chardonnay, so my review is for that wine. I find it very good when chilled properly. I take it out of the refrigerator an hour before drinking it & it's perfect. It's not to cold or warm. When drunk too cold, it doesn't have much taste. At the proper temp, it becomes much more complex. It has a clean delicate taste of peach & apricot. It's not a heavy chardonnay. No oak, butter or vanilla undertone. I prefer this crisper, fresher chardonnay. The heavy ones make me gag.",
2854,Great Moscato : Don't know why others have given such bad reviews. I guess each person has their own taste but I love the Moscato & my family & friends also enjoy it!,
2855,"Disappointed : I'm not a wine drinker but have relatives and friends who are, so I purchased 12 bottles to have on hand at home and also for gifts. My brother visited this weekend and I opened the red wine for him to enjoy during a football game. He tried to be gracious but finally said it just wasn't good. Now I'm wondering what the people thought who received wine as gifts. I have eight bottles left and wondering if I should just pour them down the drain. What a disappointment after the hosts all ooo-ed and ahhh-ed over this supposedly fabulous wine assortment.",
2856,"Great valued wine : I have order three cases over past two years a great wine for the price point. Other reviews I Have read judge this to harshly. Including shipping it is a twelve dollar a bottle wine, I have order many wines for an average of 18.00 a bottle and not nearly as good. . I order 15 cases of wine a least every year, this is a great value in the price range it sells for",
2857,"Loved These Wines : I am not a wine expert, but I am Italian and like wine. I ordered the white selection and I absolutely love it. I enjoy a glass of wine without the meal attached. My first time ordering Moscato and it is delicious, next favorite is the White Zinfandel. The Chardonnay is also very good. Kevin did an excellent job mixing the favors. I am on auto-delivery so I am able to give them as nice gifts, but not the Moscato.",
2858,"Love it not crazy for kevin : We ordered 12 white and 12 red twice, really like them. Sweet is not a favorite, but it was good.",
2859,"I'll choose my own : Thought this would be a good sampler of wine at a very decent price. The mixed case has some wine that friends liked, some I liked. But overall the case is just non descript. Chardonnay was very light on the oaky taste. Other whites were OK. Meritage is OK. Pinot Noir was unidentifiable as such. Cab Sauv. OK. White Zin? No one wanted it. So I can't say this was a ""wonderful"" assortment. I have cancelled the remainder of the auto ship. Thanks anyway, Kevin. I'll pick my own bottles locally.",
2860,"Mediocre at best! : Not the quality at all that I was expecting from Kevin O'Leary. Very disappointed, and I would not serve this to guests.",
2861,"It's not worth the hassle : Definitely not worth the hassle, don't waste your time or your money",
2862,"using for cooking wine : The cab was the only drinkable one. Using for cooking wine. For that reason, Mr Wonderful, I'm out.",
2863,"Better than expected : First, before I purchase a wine for a second time I need to sample it. Not possible this way of course so I relied on QVC and Kevin O'Leary's reputation for making my purchase.So far I have been very pleased with the quality and taste of each of the reds in the collection, a great value for the quality and proud to serve it to guests. Look forward to next auto-ship and purchasing the white collection.",
2864,ALWAYS A HIT!! : LOVE LOVE LOVE Kevin's Reserve Wines. Just the best! 5th or 6th time ordering and will continue to order more and auto delivery. FANTASTIC deal on really great wine! Can't go wrong! A no brainer! If you love wine...DO IT!,
2865,Glad we purchased this wine : Had this wine for a few months and finally got around to tasting...we ordered the 12 bottle sampler set and we are loving the Chardonnay and the Syrah...cannot wait to taste the others...Will order again.,
2866,Not very good : I'm not a wine snob but I've had my fair share of wine over the years. I taste new brands fairly regularly. You can do much better at your local store for the same or less money. Basically tastes like a good box wine. Black Box ... etc.,
2867,Excellent value : The Cabernet is a true value. The Chardonnay is also great.,
2868,"consistently smooth and delicious : We have ordered both white and red sets of O'Leary wines more than once, and we have had consistently excellent wine with every single bottle.The sweet wines are delicate and blended perfectly without being too sweet. The rich reds are deep without being too tannic or biting. When we need a wine we can count on to be perfect for guests, or gifts or just enjoying with our everyday meals, this is our go-to wine.We recommend it highly.",
2869,Worst Ever : I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I’ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression “rot gut”.,
2870,"Don't bother... : If you're a selective wine drinker, don't buy this. It's mediocre at best. Will likely end up using for cooking.",
2871,"Barely average wine : I wish I had returned this wine, but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying. Have ordered Vintage Wine Estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed. O'Lerary's reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members. Not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what, but just no happy with these and would not order again. Kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable, but there is better wine available at lower cost.",
2872,"Not Happy With Auto Delivery : Purchased on auto delivery. First shipment great, second came with 6 bottle of sav but no moscato. We do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles. Third shipment came with the moscato and 3 more sav. Shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment. Moscato is great others are ok. Trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even ""included"" makes it costly. Disappointed.",
2873,"Good mix : I'm really picky about wine. To be honest, I've had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance. I actually really really liked the moscato. Moscato is my favorite type of wine and I've had a lot that I don't care for. If you like Bartenura, you will appreciate this. I liked the white zin also. I didn't care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" I'd like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. I'd say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who haven't heard of the bartenura comparison, it's a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as O'Leary. If you're curious about this, if say take a chance. Regardless how I feel about the taste of the chardonnay, they are all quite fragrant which I enjoy.",
2874,"Not what I was hoping for : I purchased the 12 bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage. I usually drink Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. I wish the wines lived up to their descriptions, but sadly they did not. I realize tastes are subjective, but for me, the Chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste. I would not order these again..",
2875,"Cab is good, Pinot is not : I am a Pinot Noir wine drinker generally, but the Pinot Noir in this case is terrible, even after decanting. Have tried two of the Pinot bottles and a few of each of the others. I actually prefer the Cab over anything in the case and I usually don't like cabs.",
2876,"Worst Purchase I Have Ever Made! : Can't believe that I was so stupid to fall for Kevin O'Leary's promotion of his wines. I believed in him, and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety.dozen bottles. What a fool I have been! I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, but I continue to be disappointed. Yes, I know I have a month to return the merchandise! What a laugh!! How to return a huge package? I poured most in the kitchen sink... live and learn.",
2877,Worst Ever : I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I���ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression ���rot gut���.,
2878,"fine wines : I am more of a dry wine person, but I have enjoyed the chardoney and rose. Not to sweet, not to dry. Great gifts my friends said they enjoyed",
2879,"I EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR : I was really hopeful that I would experience a new tasting wine just because it's ""Mr. Wonderful's"" brand. However it was not as flavorful as what I had become accustomed. It's not bad it's just okay. I purchased the Zinfandel. I wanted the Moscato but it had sold out. I still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what I'm looking to purchase. I would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting.",
2880,Not Very Good : I purchased the Pinot Noir and it was terrible. Dumping it and won’t purchase again .,
2881,"Ordered More Than Once : I only like sweet (not super sweet) wine and the Moscato is absolutely delicious. I'm not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings. I'll have it with anything because it tastes that good. Like it before, during, or after dinner. It just tastes great. This is really good wine and the price is good too.",
2882,Best Ever : This is the best vine I have ever tasted. I had to reorder me a second round.,
2883,"Best purchase ever : Very unique tast,I love it you won't go wrong with this",
2884,Treat Yourself : I have ordered the set of 12 in the past. I have tried them all and enjoyed allHowever white zinfandel is my favorite. I have given them as gifts with no complaints just compliments. Soooo smooth,
2885,Excellent : I only like a sweet wine. I was skeptical on ordering without tasting it first. I am so glad I ordered it. I love it. THANKS KEVIN O'LEARY!!!,
2886,Delicious !! : I ordered a 3 bottle set of both the Meritage & Moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines. They called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile !! Said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these 3 bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties !! Thanks Kevin & QVC for a hit !!,
2887,"Sumptuous delicious wine. : I ordered the White Zinfadel in the 3 bottle selection which arrived on Friday. This wine is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. My husband and I visited Nappa Wine Valley and Sonoma Wineries about 3 years ago. Our hats off to Mr. Kevin O'Leary to bring such a joy, a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold it's own. We had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done. Thank you so much for this wonderful offering.",
2888,Excellent Moscato : This was my first purchase of these wines. Tried the Moscato as I like a sweet wine. Found it to be the best I've ever had. The only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery. Missed the UPS guy a couple times.,
2889,"O'Leary's Select Reserve Chardonnay : I don't know why the negative reviews said the wine tasted horrible..? I should have ordered a case! Mr. Wonderful, you have not promised what you haven't delivered 10-fold with this wine! I ought to go on auto ship with the case!",
